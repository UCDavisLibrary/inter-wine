        <description><![CDATA[jop<br>Judgment of Paris<br>Paris, France<br>Event<br>May 24, 1976<br>The Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 — known as the Judgment of Paris — was a wine competition organized in Paris on 24 May 1976 by Steven Spurrier, a British wine merchant, in which French judges carried out two blind tasting comparisons: one of Chardonnays and another of red wines. A Californian wine rated best in each category, which caused surprise as France was generally regarded as the foremost producer of the world’s best wines. The 1973 Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet won the red wine category. The 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay won the white wine category.]]></description>

In 1970 he moved to Paris where he persuaded an elderly lady to sell him her small wine store located in a passageway off the rue Royale. From 1971 he ran the wine shop Les Caves de la Madeleine where clients were encouraged to taste wines before they bought them, which achieved recognition as a highly regarded specialist wine shop. In 1973 he started L’Academie du Vin, France’s first private wine school, which was central to the wine education of several wine personalities such as French wine writer Michel Bettane, and Charles F. Shaw, namesake of “Two Buck Chuck”. <br>Spurrier went on to stage the influential “Judgement of Paris” Tasting of 1976, when a Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon from California were ranked above some of the most prestigious wines of Burgundy and Bordeaux.<br>Spurrier sold his wine interests in France and returned to the UK in 1988, becoming a wine consultant and journalist. He is now director of The Christie’s Wine Course, which he founded with Christie’s Education in 1982. He is also a wine consultant to Singapore Airlines, and consultant editor to Decanter.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[wwiniarski<br>Warren Winiarski<br>Napa, California<br>Person<br>1928 - Present<br>California winemaker Warren Winiarski (1928) made the 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars S.L.V. Cabernet Sauvignon that won the 1976 Judgment of Paris. The blind tasting is now considered a pivotal step in establishing the credibility of the American wine and propelling the industry forward.<br>Winiarski was in Italy studying the work of political philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli as part of his coursework for a PhD in political science from the University of Chicago when he became captivated by wine. He realized, during that year in Italy, that he wanted to pursue wine making. Ten years later, in 1964, he moved with his wife Barbara and their small children to Napa Valley to make that dream a reality. <br>Initially, Winiarski worked at Souverain Winery before, in 1966, becoming the first winemaker at the Robert Mondavi Winery. Then in 1968, Winiarski took a position at Ivancie Cellars, selecting California grapes for a Colorado wine making endeavor. In 1970, together with a group of investors, he bought a 44-acre prune orchard in the Napa Valley.

Veeder AVA in the Mayacamas Mountains within the Napa Valley AVA, bordering the Sonoma Valley AVA. The estate is known for producing wine of a more traditional style than the Napa trends of recent years that emphasizes power, weight, high levels of alcohol and extravagance. <br>The winery was built in 1889 by John Henry Fisher a German immigrant who went bankrupt in the early 1900s. It then fell into disuse for several years although bootleggers are said to have made wine in the old stone cellar during the early years of the Prohibition. During the late 1920s and 1930s the property was owned by the Brandlin family. British chemist Jack Taylor and his wife Mary bought the property in 1941, and the estate received its current name. In 1968 the winery was bought by its present owner, Robert Travers and his wife Elinor. Under their direction, the aging facilities was enlarged, neighboring land purchased, and vineyard clearing, planting and replanting are an ongoing process. <br>The winery received international recognition after its Cabernet Sauvignon was selected for competition in the 1976 "Judgment of Paris" wine competition. Robert Travers had agreed to sell three bottles of the still unreleased 1971 vintage for the event, although he did not consider it ready to drink. In the Wine Spectator Wine Tasting of 1986, blind tasters evaluated how the Cabernet Sauvignon wines had aged ten years after the Paris event. The 1971 Mayacamas Vineyards was ranked second. On the 30th anniversary of the Paris event, two panels of expert wine tasters tasted all the original red entries to assess how the wines had aged.
