        "description": "If Cabernet Sauvignon is the king of red grapes, Chardonnay is the queen of whites. Chardonnay is the most popular wine in the U.S. and has maintained its lead for the last decade. Historical references note California plantings of Chardonnay dating back to the late 1800s, but production was limited due to low yields. This is the story of California Chardonnay pre - 1970s, when plantings of the grape boomed as the wine grew in popularity."

          "Though some records indicate that Chardonnay was present in California during the mid–late 19th century, it had a very limited role. Producers like Stony Hill Vineyard and Hanzell began to work with the grape with great success in the 1950s, but it existed purely on the margins; in 1960 there were only around 150 documented acres of Chardonnay in the state. But its popularity continued to grow at a rapid pace in the 1960s, and after Chateau Montelena's Chardonnay bested some of Burgundy's most iconic wines in the 1976 Judgment of Paris, Chardonnay's boom was supersonic.",
          "The value of the Chardonnay grape to wine producers lies, perhaps counter-intuitively, in its neutrality. The notable grape breeder Harold Olmo said of Chardonnay, \"There is little in the way of distinct flavor, in either the grape or the new wine, until the fruit is almost overripe...However, it is exactly this delicacy and cleanness of taste...that make it... a delight to the consumer.\"",
          "Chardonnay and its parent, Pinot noir, are the two classic varieties used in Champagne, in which Chardonnay’s neutral character leaves space for the expression of the mellow aromas developed in the bottle. The finesse of fine Chardonnay wines, opined winemaker, Eleanor Mcrea, \"is as unmistakable as Beethoven, [yet] there are many variations on the theme.\" That Chardonnay \"responds gracefully to many approaches\" makes it a canvas for the expression of vineyard and vinification. While some pioneering Chardonnay producers in California sought to reproduce the high acid, crisp style of Chablis, or of the richer quality of Burgundy white, still others have worked with riper grapes, acid-lowering malolactic fermentation and oak-barrel aging to develop the now familiar \"California Style\"."

          "At the start of the 1960s there were only 300 acres of Chardonnay planted in all of California. Today the grape is planted to more than 100,000 acres.",
          "The California Chardonnay that wine writer Hugh Johnson describes in Vintage: The Story of Wine as having the \"buttery, half-smoked aromas and flavours that had … spelt only Meursault, Montrachet, and Corton-Charlemagne\" didn't have a well-defined presence in California until after Joseph Heitz bought, blended, and sold James D. Zellerbach's last vintages, and showed that California could produce wine that would stand up to top white Burgundies.",
          "Timing, skill, doggedness, a knack for promotion, and the Judgment of Paris propelled Heitz's Chardonnays into an international arena, but the stage for Chardonnay's rise in California had been set decades before Prohibition, in Livermore, by a group of immigrant winemakers and a San Franciscan whose dry white wine won California's first international wine award at the 1889 Paris Exposition."

          "Chardonnay's presence among early California wines is hard to trace due to the absence of varietal labeling before the 1930s, variations on the grape’s spelling, and mistakes in identification. It wasn't uncommon for Chardonnay to be mistaken for Pinot Blanc and Melon de Bourgogne.",
          "The grape's stateside story begins to come into focus in 1882, when Charles Wetmore imported budwood from Meursault and established his Cresta Blanca vineyard in Livermore. Chardonnay roots developed in Livermore nurseries and vineyards as well as in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where Livermore winegrower Paul Masson planted a second vineyard to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, using cuttings from Burgundy purportedly from the vineyards of winegrower Louis Latour."

Plantings of Chardonnay were so small that the variety was not recorded specifically\".",

          "Heitz's acumen as a businessman and winemaker; the publication of the first volume of Julia Child’s book Mastering the Art of French Cooking, in 1961, with volume 2 following in 1970; and the Judgment of Paris were further fuel for Chardonnay’s rise. The rest, as they say, is history."

Spurrier invited nine of France’s wine experts to participate in a blind tasting that pitted esteemed reds from Bordeaux and whites from Burgundy against Cabernet Sauvignons and Chardonnays from California. Spurrier curated the selection of Napa Valley wines with help from Gastaud-Gallagher and an American wine tour organizer, Joanne DePuy, who would later transport the California wines to Paris for the tasting."

The horizon expanded for winemakers throughout the world, who were encouraged to imagine previously unconsidered regions for the production of fine wines made with the noble varieties. The wide-reaching spirit of competition and possibility that the tasting engendered also caused experimentation with winemaking methods and grape varieties to increase. Reflecting on the event forty years later for Time, Spurrier said, \"The most important thing in my view is the Judgment of Paris created a template whereby unknown wines of high quality could go up against known benchmark wines of high quality, blind, provided they were in front of an incredibly reputable panel of judges. Davids from all over felt power to take on Goliaths. It was a great democratizing moment for vintners.\""
