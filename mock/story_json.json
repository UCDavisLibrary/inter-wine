          "Though some records indicate that Chardonnay was present in California during the mid–late 19th century, it had a very limited role. Producers like Stony Hill Vineyard and Hanzell began to work with the grape with great success in the 1950s, but it existed purely on the margins; in 1960 there were only around 150 documented acres of Chardonnay in the state. But its popularity continued to grow at a rapid pace in the 1960s, and after Chateau Montelena's Chardonnay bested some of Burgundy's most iconic wines in the 1976 Judgment of Paris, Chardonnay's boom was supersonic.",
          "The value of the Chardonnay grape to wine producers lies, perhaps counter-intuitively, in its neutrality. The notable grape breeder Harold Olmo said of Chardonnay, \"There is little in the way of distinct flavor, in either the grape or the new wine, until the fruit is almost overripe...However, it is exactly this delicacy and cleanness of taste...that make it... a delight to the consumer.\"",
          "Chardonnay and its parent, Pinot noir, are the two classic varieties used in Champagne, in which Chardonnay’s neutral character leaves space for the expression of the mellow aromas developed in the bottle. The finesse of fine Chardonnay wines, opined winemaker, Eleanor Mcrea, \"is as unmistakable as Beethoven, [yet] there are many variations on the theme.\" That Chardonnay \"responds gracefully to many approaches\" makes it a canvas for the expression of vineyard and vinification. While some pioneering Chardonnay producers in California sought to reproduce the high acid, crisp style of Chablis, or of the richer quality of Burgundy white, still others have worked with riper grapes, acid-lowering malolactic fermentation and oak-barrel aging to develop the now familiar \"California Style\"."

Zellerbach's last vintages, and showed that California could produce wine that would stand up to top white Burgundies.",
          "Timing, skill, doggedness, a knack for promotion, and the Judgment of Paris propelled Heitz's Chardonnays into an international arena, but the stage for Chardonnay's rise in California had been set decades before Prohibition, in Livermore, by a group of immigrant winemakers and a San Franciscan whose dry white wine won California's first international wine award at the 1889 Paris Exposition."

Chardonnay roots developed in Livermore nurseries and vineyards as well as in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where Livermore winegrower Paul Masson planted a second vineyard to Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, using cuttings from Burgundy purportedly from the vineyards of winegrower Louis Latour."
