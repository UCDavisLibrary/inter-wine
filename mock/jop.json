Although Ridge Vineyards was founded in the early 1960s, wine production at the winery's Monte Bello location has a much longer history dating back to 1885, when an Italian doctor named Osea Perrone bought 180 acres near the top of Monte Bello Ridge. He planted vineyards and produced his first vintage under the name Monte Bello Winery in 1892. After Prohibition, the vineyard exchanged several hands before eventually becoming Ridge Vineyards after a group of engineers purchased it in 1959. Its first commercial wine, a Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon, was produced in 1962. Ridge Vineyard's 1971 Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon achieved international fame for its fifth place finish in the 1976 \"Judgement of Paris\" wine tasting. Ridge now produces wine at two winery locations in northern California. The original winery facilities are located at an elevation of 2,300 feet on Monte Bello Ridge in the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA. The other Ridge winery facilities are at Lytton Springs in the Dry Creek Valley AVA of Sonoma County.",

Unlike the majority of the wood-constructed wineries in Napa, the Chateau was built of stone with walls three to twelve feet thick. Being built into a hillside and made of stone, the chateau provides natural insulation against fluctuating external temperatures, which is helpful for producing quality wine.  After a break from winemaking caused by Prohibition, Tubbs' grandson Chapin Tubbs took over and renamed the winery Chateau Montelena Winery, a contraction of Mount St. Helena, in 1940. Two years after Chapin Tubbs died in 1947, wine production ceased again for nearly two decades.  In the 1970s, the winery was revived under Jim Barrett's leadership. It then became famous for winning the white wine section of the 1976 Judgment of Paris wine competition, where it was blind tasted against nine other wines from France and California. All eleven judges awarded their top scores to the Chardonnays from either Chateau Montelena or Chalone Winery, another California wine producer.",

    "description" : "California winemaker Warren Winiarski made the 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars S.L.V. Cabernet Sauvignon that won the 1976 Judgment of Paris. The blind tasting is now considered a pivotal step in establishing the credibility of the American wine and propelling the industry forward. Winiarski was in Italy studying the work of political philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli as part of his coursework for a PhD in political science from the University of Chicago when he became captivated by wine. He realized, during that year in Italy, that he wanted to pursue wine making. Ten years later, in 1964, he moved with his wife Barbara and their small children to Napa Valley to make that dream a reality. Initially, Winiarski worked at Souverain Winery before, in 1966, becoming the first winemaker at the Robert Mondavi Winery. Then in 1968, Winiarski took a position at Ivancie Cellars, selecting California grapes for a Colorado wine making endeavor. In 1970, together with a group of investors, he bought a 44-acre prune orchard in the Napa Valley. He planted Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes on the land and built a winery near the vineyard and founded Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars in 1973. It was Winiarski’s first vintage, Stag’s Leap Wine Cellar 1973 Cabernet, was selected for that historic 1976 blind tasting, the Judgment of Paris and won first place among ten French and California red wines. In 2007, Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars was sold for $185 million to a partnership of St. Michelle Wine Estates of Washington State and Marchesi Antinori of Tuscany.",

It is one of the few wineries in the U.S. growing grapes in limestone-based soils, the same as in Burgundy. The spare, well-drained ground, limited rainfall, and low crop levels attracted Dick Graff, who wanted to make top-ﬂight Burgundian-styled Chardonnay. Graff made his ﬁrst vintage under the Chalone Vineyard label in 1966, producing what became a benchmark for California Chardonnay. Chalone Vineyard achieved third rank out of ten from France and the U.S. in the historic Judgment of Paris wine competition. All 11 judges awarded their top scores to either Chalone Vineyard or Chateau Montelena, also of California. Today, Chalone Vineyard continues to focus on Chardonnay and Pinot noir. They also produce limited amounts of Pinot blanc, Chenin blanc and Syrah. All of the estate wines are grown and bottled at the estate, controlling everything from vine to bottle.",

The estate owns vineyards in Chablis, the Côte de Nuits, Côte de Beaune and Côte Chalonnaise, as well as in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Drouhin is one of the major winemakers of Burgundy, and produces wines made from purchased grapes grown in different parts of Burgundy.

Beaune Clos des Mouches Joseph Drouhin is made from grapes grown in the Clos des Mouches, a Beaune Premier Cru vineyard of the Côte de Beaune. Clos de Mouches is a Premier Cru vineyard within the commune of Beaune, and was purchased by Drouhin in the 19th Century, which produces both red and white wines. White Clos des Mouches from Drouhin generally command a slightly higher price than the red wine. The 1973 vintage ranked number five in the historic Judgment of Paris wine competition between ten French and California white wines. In the New York Wine Tasting of 1973, the winery's 1969 was ranked in fifth place after four California Chardonnays. Beaune Clos des Mouches Joseph Drouhin also competed in the \"Great Chardonnay Showdown\" wine competition held in 1980.",

His four-paragraph story about the tasting has been called \"the most significant news story ever written about wine.\" In 2005, Taber wrote a book on the event, with the goal of \"setting the record straight.\" In 2012, Taber organized a blind tasting on behalf of the American Association of Wine Economists similar to the 1976 Judgment of Paris event between wines produced in France and several produced in New Jersey. This event at the Association's conference in Princeton has been called the Judgment of Princeton.

    "description" : "Mayacamas Vineyards is a California wine producer located in the Mt. Veeder AVA in the Mayacamas Mountains within the Napa Valley AVA, bordering the Sonoma Valley AVA. The estate is known for producing wine of a more traditional style than the Napa trends of recent years that emphasizes power, weight, high levels of alcohol and extravagance. The winery was built in 1889 by John Henry Fisher a German immigrant who went bankrupt in the early 1900s. It then fell into disuse for several years although bootleggers are said to have made wine in the old stone cellar during the early years of the Prohibition. During the late 1920s and 1930s the property was owned by the Brandlin family. British chemist Jack Taylor and his wife Mary bought the property in 1941, and the estate received its current name. In 1968 the winery was bought by its present owner, Robert Travers and his wife Elinor. Under their direction, the aging facilities was enlarged, neighboring land purchased, and vineyard clearing, planting and replanting are an ongoing process.  The winery received international recognition after its Cabernet sauvignon was selected for competition in the 1976 Judgment of Paris wine competition, where it came in ninth place of the ten red wines tasted. Robert Travers had agreed to sell three bottles of the still unreleased 1971 vintage for the event, although he did not consider it ready to drink. In the Wine Spectator Wine Tasting of 1986, blind tasters evaluated how the Cabernet Sauvignon wines had aged ten years after the Paris event. The 1971 Mayacamas Vineyards was ranked second. On the 30th anniversary of the Paris event, two panels of expert wine tasters tasted all the original red entries to assess how the wines had aged. Mayacamas Vineyards tied for third place with Heitz Cellar in the field of ten.",
